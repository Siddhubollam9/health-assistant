# Healthcare Assistant Chatbot 🏥

A **Streamlit-based chatbot** that provides **healthcare-related assistance** using **Transformers** (Hugging Face) and **NLTK** for text processing. It can answer basic medical queries, offer rule-based responses, and provide AI-powered answers for general healthcare topics.

## Features ✨
✅ Provides **quick healthcare advice** based on user input  
✅ Uses **pre-trained RoBERTa model** for AI-powered question answering  
✅ Rule-based responses for common queries (symptoms, appointments, medications)  
✅ **Streamlit UI** for an interactive chatbot experience  

## Installation 🛠️
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
